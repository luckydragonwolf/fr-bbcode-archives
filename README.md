# fr-bbcode-archives
An archive of Flight Rising BBcode templates, all free to use. 

# What are these used for?
Flight Rising BBcode is used to format things such as **forum posts, dragon biographies, and a player's clan info page.** Not everybody wants to take the time to create their own code for these, so this repository is dedicated to holding different templates, all in a .txt format!
# How can I contribute?
For now, to contribute, you will have to DM me on Flight Rising (ID 618561). I can add the code you send **as long as you either wrote it yourself and are fine with it being used by others, or if you have permission from the creator of the code to contribute it to the archive.**
