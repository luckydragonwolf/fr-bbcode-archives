# fr-bbcode-archives
An archive of Flight Rising BBcode templates, all free to use. 

# What are these used for
Flight Rising BBcode is used to format things such as **forum posts, dragon biographies, and a player's clan info page.** Not everybody wants to take the time to create their own code for these, so this repository is dedicated to holding different templates, all in a .txt format!
